USER_FEEDBACK

We have an elaborate authoring environment front end that interacts with the back end, but we can focus on checking edge and border cases, cases with erroneous inputs, and invalid cases.

We could make the GUI have greater styling appeal, even though we are focusing on design and smoother functionality.

The different tabs and GUI elements for different game-designing functions could be slightly less ambiguous and contain slightly better direction and structure.
